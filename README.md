You may find my solution: **src > HW_3 > allsolution**

## Problem Descriptions
Create class Car: id, Make, Model, Year of manufacture, Color, Price, Registration number. Create an array of objects.
Save to the different files

1. **Modify previous HomeTask2 and create a following hierarchy**
   
2. **Create superclass Engine and subclasses CombustionEngine, ElectricEngine
and HybridEngine.**

3. **Create class Manufacture, with all setters and getters.**
4. **Create superclass Vehicle with abstract method ShowCharacteristics().
Create three subclasses ICEV, BEV, HybridV.**
5.  **Each subclass of class Vehicle should have attribute the of class Manufacture
and Engine.**
6.  **Create arrays of Vechicle which contains objects of ICEV, BEV, HybridV.**
7.  **Use method ShowCharacteristics() to demonstrate result.**
